# Customer Churn Prediction App

This repository contains a **Customer Churn Prediction** app that allows users to predict whether a customer will churn or not, based on their data and behaviors. The app utilizes machine learning models to make predictions and provides a user-friendly interface through **Streamlit**.

## Features

- **Model Training and Prediction**: The app uses a machine learning model to predict customer churn.
- **Interactive UI**: Powered by Streamlit, the app allows users to input customer data and view predictions in real-time.
- **Visualization**: The app provides visual insights into customer churn patterns using charts and graphs.

## Project Overview

The project leverages a dataset that contains customer information such as age, account length, services subscribed to, and other features, which are then used to predict the likelihood of customer churn. The app provides a clean and simple interface to input data and receive predictions.

### How It Works:
1. **Input Data**: Users can input or upload customer data into the app.
2. **Model Prediction**: The app uses a trained machine learning model to analyze the data and predict whether the customer is likely to churn.
3. **Results Visualization**: Results are displayed, including the probability of churn and other insights such as visualizations of churn trends across different segments of data.
